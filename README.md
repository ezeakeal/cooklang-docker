# cooklang-docker

This repository only provides Docker images containing the upstream [CookCLI](https://github.com/cooklang/CookCLI) and does not alter the source code. It was created for my personal use case of hosting a `cook server` on my local network.

All credit to [Alexey Dubovskoy](https://github.com/dubadub) and the rest of the cooklang contributors.
